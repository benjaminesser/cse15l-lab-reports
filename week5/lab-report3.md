# Lab Report 3

I chose to look at the `find` command.

### -iname

![iname1](iname1.png)
In this example, I use `-iname` to to find a txt file that contains algarve. This is useful because I don't have to know the exact file name or capitalization.

![iname2](iname2.png)
Similar to the example above, I use iname to find a a file that contains both bermud and history. This is useful to find a file that you know multiple parts of but not the whole name.

### -type

!
